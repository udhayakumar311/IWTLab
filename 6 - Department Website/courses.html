	<h2>Fields Of Study</h2><br>
	<p>Most universities have defined “graduate schools” or “graduate colleges”; however, PU is different in that all of our schools offer graduate programs. There are five schools at PU including: Architecture and Planning; Engineering; Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences; Management; and Science. Each of these five schools oversees several departments and programs. The School itself is not responsible for the admission of students; instead each department or program manages its own admissions process.</p>
