			<p style="text-align: left;">There is growing demand for talented and skilled personnel in Computer Science to meet the present and future needs of the societal and research problems. In this background, Pondicherry University started MCA (Master of Computer Applications) course during 2000. Later in 2002, the Department offered M. Sc. in Computer Science. The M. Sc. in Computer Science is recognized by UGC and MCA is recognized by AICTE. These courses have subjects which are the combination of Pure and Applied Sciences. The students of M. Sc. Computer Science and MCA can take up Research or can become software professionals to meet the Industry need.

				The main objective is to prepare the students with good skills, which are essential for software companies, educational institutions and Research. The department possesses good collection of books & good teaching staff. There are four permanent Assistant Professors in the department. The department trains students to fulfill the current needs of software companies and research. The Department has an excellent infrastructure equipped with modern teaching aids like LCD and overhead projectors.

				Intake for both the courses is fixed to 40 students including the quotas of NCC, NSS, Physically Handicapped, Sports, Hyderabad Karnataka, and merit cum payment. For the academic year 2015-16 the intake of M. Sc. Computer Science is increased to 44 students. The percentage of passing of MCA and M. Sc. courses is excellent with 100% result.
				
				The department invites resource persons from reputed Multinational Companies (MNCs) and Academic Institutions to organize workshops based on emerging software tools & skills. The department conducts seminars, conferences, Workshops, Special Lecture series and Invited talks which provide a platform for industrial professionals, students, researchers and eminent scientists to discuss for mutual benefit.
				
				The faculty members of the department are constantly upgrading their knowledge by attending various seminars, conferences, workshops, refresher courses, orientation courses and training programmes. The department has organized national conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (NCACC 12) during April 2012. Also the department has conducted three national workshops and one national seminar in the last five years.
				
				Along with master degree courses the department also offers Research programme Ph. D. in Computer Science. Ph. D. programme intake is eight students for each guide. At present, the department is actively engaged in research in the areas of digital image processing, pattern recognition and data mining. The department has awarded more than 15 Ph. D. degrees in the last five years and the department has a publication of about 86 research articles in reputed national and international peer reviewed journals.
				
				The students of the department are well placed in academic, administrative and software industries. Few became entrepreneurs in the field of IT. The alumni of the department are active.
